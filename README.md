## What is AWMate?

AWMate is an AI coding workspace designed to understand and operate on the project you select. It combines conversation, code exploration, file editing, command execution, and development workflows in one interface.

The project includes a native Electron desktop application, a terminal interface, a shared web UI, an API server, and reusable SDK packages.

## Highlights

- Project-aware conversations that stay scoped to the selected folder
- Desktop, terminal, and web experiences backed by the same core
- Build and plan agents for implementation and read-only analysis
- Integrated file, search, terminal, and development tools
- Multiple sessions and project tabs
- Windows and WSL integration
- Extensible provider, plugin, protocol, and SDK packages
- Open-source and self-hostable
